  <h1 class="mb-16">Hello world!</h1>
  <p class="mb-16">
    This is a testing ground with various design explorations for Harvestapp and Porchlight. Please approach it with caution and many grains-of-salt. Here be dragons. To see what sections are available in this prototype, <strong>hold down the CMD key</strong>.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-16">
    Some of the ideas I’m exploring include:
  </p>
  <ul class="ml-16">
    <li class="mb-16">
      <strong>Accessible rebrand</strong><br>
      Leaning more heavily into the new brand, but altered to work better with a modern web app and be more accessible. It was entirely unplanned that, with this style, Harvest kinda looks more like Toggl Track. Our warm-white is similar to their background.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-16">
      <strong>Left-side navigation</strong><br>
      Offers more space to include iconography, group related sections, and match a full-width responsive Harvest. It also feels more modern.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-16">
      <strong>Iconography</strong><br>
      Attempting to use more distinct iconography. Helps create relationships and more easily identify actions. Icons should be accompanied by text as much as possible.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-16">
      <strong>Consistent headlines</strong><br>
      Attempting to name every page in the app. This is an IA design that can help customers understand where they are, and offer us a clear space to link education info.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-16">
      <strong>Consistent components</strong><br>
      Attempting to make everything as consistent as possible across every page in the app. This includes timeframe selectors, filters, export buttons, summaries, and more.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-16">
      <strong>Approval section</strong><br>
      Approving time and/or expenses is a specific function that can and should stand on it’s own, especially if we invest more heavily into expenses.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-16">
      <strong>Report library</strong><br>
      Our reporting section is growing beyond the scope and support of a sub-nav, and it’s getting harder to understand which report is best for which need. Testing an alternate design here that displays all of the reports available in Harvest first, with explanations and helpful imagery. We can then support more and saved reports. Also linking to Projects and Team sections here for IA purposes.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-16">
      <strong>Manage &rarr; More</strong><br>
      While the side navigation grouping helps bridge some IA confusion, the “Manage” section can still be problematic when it doesn’t contain projects and people. By renaming it to “More” it’s easier to understand the sections within will be similar to nearby sections.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-16">
      <strong>Bulk actions</strong><br>
      Every row of every table is has a dedicated actions button and is selectable for bulk actions. A disabled bulk actions button shows where that button would appear.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-16">
      <strong>Dark mode</strong><br>
      It’s not optimized, but I showcase how this design could support dark mode, which is an accessibility feature of modern operating systems loved by many people. Currently just follows your system settings.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-16">
      <strong>Responsive for mobile devices</strong><br>
      It’s not optimized, but I’ve tried to make this prototype work well on smaller screens like current Harvest.
    </li>
  </ul>
  Still to do:<br>
  – Optimize menu button for mobile and tablet<br>
  – Optimize time and expense rows for mobile and tablet<br>
  – Add onboarding education to timesheet
