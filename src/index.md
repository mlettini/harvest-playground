  <h1 class="mb-16">Hello world!</h1>
  <p class="mb-16">
    This is a testing ground with various design explorations for Harvestapp and Porchlight. Please approach it with caution and many grains-of-salt. Here be dragons. Some of the ideas I’m exploring include:
  </p>
  <ul class="ml-16">
    <li class="mb-16">
      <strong>Left-side navigation</strong><br>
      Offers more space to include iconography, group related sections, feel more modern, and match a full-width responsive Harvest.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-16">
      <strong>Manage &rarr; More</strong><br>
      While the navigation grouping helps bridge some IA confusion, the “Manage” section is still problematic. By renaming it to “More”, it highlights that other nearby sections are also management focused.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-16">
      <strong>Consistent headlines</strong><br>
      Attempting to name (almost) every page in the app. This is an IA iteration that can help customers understand where they are and a space for us to link help info.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-16">
      <strong>Consistent components</strong><br>
      Attempting to make everything as consistent as possible across every page in the app. This includes timeframe selectors, filters, export buttons, summaries, and more.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-16">
      <strong>Accessible rebrand</strong><br>
      Leaning more heavily into the new brand, but altered to work better with a modern web app and be more accessible. It was entirely unplanned that, with this style, Harvest kinda looks more like Toggl Track. Our warm-white is similar to their background.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-16">
      <strong>Automatic dark mode</strong><br>
      Showcasing how this design can support dark mode, which is an accessibility feature of modern operating systems loved by many people.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-16">
      <strong>Responsive for mobile devices</strong><br>
      Perhaps not optimized for phone screens, but the app works at that size.
    </li>
  </ul>
