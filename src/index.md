  <h1 class="mb-16">Hello world!</h1>
  <p class="mb-16">
    This is a testing ground with various design explorations for Harvestapp and Porchlight. Please approach it with caution and many grains-of-salt. Here be dragons. To see what sections are available in this prototype, <strong>hold down the CMD key</strong>.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-16">
    Some of the ideas I’m exploring include:
  </p>
  <ul class="ml-16">
    <li class="mb-16">
      <strong>Left-side navigation</strong><br>
      Offers more space to include iconography, group related sections, feel more modern, and match a full-width responsive Harvest.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-16">
      <strong>Manage &rarr; More</strong><br>
      While the navigation grouping helps bridge some IA confusion, the “Manage” section can still be problematic. By renaming it to “More” it’s easier to understand the sections within will be similar to nearby sections.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-16">
      <strong>Consistent headlines</strong><br>
      Attempting to name every page in the app. This is an IA design that can help customers understand where they are, and offer us a clear space to link education info.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-16">
      <strong>Consistent components</strong><br>
      Attempting to make everything as consistent as possible across every page in the app. This includes timeframe selectors, filters, export buttons, summaries, and more.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-16">
      <strong>Bulk actions</strong><br>
      Every row of every table is has a dedicated actions button and is selectable for bulk actions. A disabled bulk actions button shows where that button would appear.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-16">
      <strong>Iconography</strong><br>
      Attempting to use more distinct iconography. Helps create relationships and more easily identify actions. Icons should be accompanied by text as much as possible.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-16">
      <strong>Accessible rebrand</strong><br>
      Leaning more heavily into the new brand, but altered to work better with a modern web app and be more accessible. It was entirely unplanned that, with this style, Harvest kinda looks more like Toggl Track. Our warm-white is similar to their background.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-16">
      <strong>Automatic dark mode</strong><br>
      Showcasing how this design could support dark mode, which is an accessibility feature of modern operating systems loved by many people.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-16">
      <strong>Responsive for mobile devices</strong><br>
      Perhaps not optimized for phone screens, but the app works at that size.
    </li>
  </ul>
